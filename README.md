This repository contains some concepts and tests for the Memries project I'm working on.

## About Memries

Memries' goal is to make it easier to enjoy photos and videos.

This means:
- backups without worrying about backups
- intuitive way to catalog images, create albums, find duplicates, etc.
- protect and share photos with the ones you love (or like)
- turn photos into memories using automatic album generation

And from technical perspective:
- self-hosted on your own hardware
- facial and object recognition for photos
- automatic tagging, indexing
